# StrongerCesarCipher

This is a better version of the Cesar Cipher by me. 

It has 2 keys, the first is the standard one, the 2nd key is the added one, which can be any word. 
Once the 2nd key is entered, based on it, the alphabet is rearranged. 

I coded this cipher in C++ because I didn't find anything related to it on internet, so I made it by myself. ;)
